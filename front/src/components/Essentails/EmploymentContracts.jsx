        <p className=" mb-6">
          A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties
          outlining their rights, duties, and obligations. It ensures clarity,
          accountability, and enforceability in business or personal dealings.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold  mb-4">Why Draft a Contract?</h2>
        <p>
          Drafting a contract protects the interests of all parties, minimizes
          misunderstandings, and serves as legal proof in case of disputes. A
          well-drafted contract provides security and builds trust in any
          transaction.
