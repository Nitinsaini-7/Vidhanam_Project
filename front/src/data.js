    q: "What makes a Will valid?",
    a: "Legal Document: The Will must follow the law and be made by someone who is legally allowed to do so.

  },

  {
    q: "Who can make a Will?",

  },
  {
    q: "Why should I make a Will, and what happens if I don’t?",
    a: "If you don’t make a Will: Your property may go to someone you didn’t intend to leave it to. If you have young children, the court might assign a guardian, which may not be someone you would have chosen. There could be disputes among your family members about who gets what. Making a Will ensures your wishes are followed. You can also name someone to handle your property after your death (like an Executor or Administrator) and choose backup beneficiaries if your main beneficiary passes away before you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I change my Will after making it?",
    a: "Yes, you can change your Will as many times as you like during your lifetime. Just make a new Will and clearly mention that it cancels any previous ones.",

  },
  {
    q: "Can a Will be challenged in court?",
    a: "Yes, a Will can be challenged if someone believes it was made under pressure, fraud, or when the person wasn’t of sound mind. It’s important to write the Will clearly and get legal advice to avoid disputes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it necessary to register a Will?",
    a: "No, registering a Will is not required. However, registering it can make it harder to challenge and easier to prove in court.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I die without a Will?",
    a: "If you die without a Will, the law decides who gets your property based on inheritance rules, which may not match your wishes. This process is called intestate succession.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I make sure my Will is safe?",
    a: "You can keep the Will in a safe place, like a bank locker or with a trusted family member. You can also register it to ensure it’s officially recorded.",

  {
    q: "Can I include minor children in my Will?",
    a: "Yes, you can name a guardian for your minor children in your Will to make sure someone you trust takes care of them if something happens to you.",
